# DESC_EELG

Basic files for a project on modeling extreme emission line galaxies and their detection limits as a photo-z platinum sample for LSST-DESC.

Currently, the repo contains only a Jupyter notebook meant to illustrate the use of the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) library of Conroy, Gunn, & White (2009), ApJ, 699, 486. This is meant to be built upon in the course of the LSST-DESC Hack day (14 July 2017).

FSPS is available with installation instructions at https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps
and a set of python bindings - Python-FSPS, is available at http://dan.iel.fm/python-fsps/current/

For ease in using the LSST filter curves, I also recommend insalling Speclite, which provides a set of lightweight tools to play around with spectra, available here: http://speclite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
